# Stardew Valley Mod Manager
## A web-based mod manager for Stardew Valley
### Version 1.0

Greetings farmer, this project aims to build a fully functional, quick and lightweight mod manager for Stardew Valley. This mod manager wants to keep as much of the bright and happy feel of Stardew Valley whilst being very simple to use for just about anybody to start modding their game!

This project is currently a work in progress and new releases are coming out all the time. This project currently has no workable features, however work is being made continually to get to our first release.

Here is the roadmap for version 1.0:

- Being able to have multiple mod profiles for storing multiple mods seperately which can then be swapped and changed easily.
- Being able to add mods to your folder by selecting a .zip file
- Also with this being web-based and using the latest web technologies, unfortunately there is a tiny amount of prepping a user will have to do before they can fully start using this mod manager. So because of that we will need a help/support/FAQ section to help get people started. Even if this only covers the very basics of getting up and running.
